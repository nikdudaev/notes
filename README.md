# My Notes

This is a repository for my notes, thoughts, and ideas.

## Setup

I use two computers: a Mac at work and Debian at home.

I create two branches for each computer: `mac` and `debian`.
I push changes to the remote repository using the following commands:

```
git push origin mac
git push origin debian
```

I pull changes from the remote repository using the following commands:

```
git pull origin mac
git pull origin debian
```

My `main` branch contains `.gitignore` and `README.md`.
